### Problem Statement:

You are given an array of strings S. Your task is to determine the total number of "good" strings present in this array.

A string T is considered a "good" string if and only if no character within the string appears more than (length of T /2) times.

#### Input:
An array of strings, S.

#### Output:
An integer representing the total count of "good" strings found in the input array S.

#### Example:
For the input array S = ['j', 'm', 'xiciw', 'uouok'], 
the output should be 2 i.e 'xiciw' and 'uouok'.
you just need to output the count which in this case is 2.
